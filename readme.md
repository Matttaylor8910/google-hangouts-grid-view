Huge thanks to [Fugiman's userscript](https://github.com/Fugiman/google-meet-grid-view) which the [meet extension](https://github.com/stgeorgesepiscopal/google-meet-grid-view-extension) uses and to [paulirish's extension](https://github.com/paulirish/google-hangouts-grid-view) which I used as a base.
